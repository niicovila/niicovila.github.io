Mathematical Engineering in Data Science at Pompeu Fabra. Exchange student at University of Chicago

I recently finished my undergraduate studies in Mathematical Engineering on Data Science at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/). During the last year, where I studied as an exchange student at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), I developed a strong passion for Deep Learning and AI, which led me on to work as a research assistant at the Law School, focusing on [fine-tuning LLMs for specific legal applications](https://niicovila.github.io/projects/6_project/). As I explored a more rigorous study on how machines can learn and reason, this passion has recently developed into a strong interest in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL). 

I recently finished my [undergraduate thesis](https://github.com/niicovila/Entropy-RL-Linear-Programming) under the advisory of [Gergely Neu](https://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/), focused on researching an alternative approach to traditional Deep RL algorithms, rooted on the Linear Program reformulation for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Using neural networks in this framework, we demonstrated that one can also create new Deep RL algorithms that compete with well-known Deep RL algorithms like DQN, SAC or PPO, without needing tricks like gradient clipping, target networks or double q networks. We also propose a novel algorithm “Primal-dual approximate policy iteration” rooted in this linear program reformulation and prove that it can be a strong alternative in large scale settings too.
