Mathematical Engineering in Data Science at Pompeu Fabra. Exchange student at University of Chicago

I am final-year student at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/), graduating in Mathematical Engineering on Data Science. During the last year, where I studied as an exchange student at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), I developed a strong passion for Deep Learning and AI in general, which led me on to work as a research assistant at the Law School, focusing on the timely topic of fine-tuning LLMs for specific legal applications. As I explored a more rigorous study on how machines can learn, this passion has recently developed into a strong interest in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL). 

I recently finished my [undergraduate thesis]([https://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/](https://github.com/niicovila/Entropy-RL-Linear-Programming)) under the advisory of [Gergely Neu](https://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/), focused on researching how practical algorithms rooted in the Linear Programming framework for MDPs can be applied in a large-scale setting using DNNs.
