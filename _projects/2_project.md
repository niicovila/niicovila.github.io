Water distribution networks in urban environments face the crucial challenge of detecting anomalies like leaks, excessive consumption, or meter errors. These anomalies often go unnoticed until significant water loss occurs. This project tackles this critical issue by presenting a novel, adaptable deep learning meta-model specifically designed for anomaly detection in water meter data.

### Leveraging Deep Learning for Time Series

Traditional machine learning methods like SVMs and Isolation Forests often struggle with large, time-dependent datasets like water consumption data. Deep learning methods, on the other hand, have shown promising results in anomaly detection tasks. Transformers, in particular, excel at identifying complex patterns in sequential data, making them a strong candidate for this application ([Tuli, Casale, & Jennings, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07284)).

[Our model](https://github.com/davidperezcarrasco/Anomaly-Detection-Hierarchical-Deep-Learning-Model), leveraging the power of LSTMs and Transformers, effectively captures sequential consumption patterns and identifies deviations from normal behavior. This enables early detection of anomalies, potentially leading to significant cost savings for both water companies and consumers, while promoting sustainable water usage.

### Multi-Stage Hierarchical Architecture

The core of this project lies in its hierarchical deep learning architecture, specifically designed for anomaly detection in water consumption data. This multi-stage training approach fosters specialization in the later stages while preserving valuable generalizations learned earlier.

This balance between adaptability to specific data patterns and overall robustness in anomaly detection is achieved through the integration of three key components:

- **[TranAD](https://github.com/imperial-qore/TranAD)**: This transformer-based model excels at identifying deviations in time series data. It undergoes a two-phase adversarial training process to capture both short-term trends and long-term dependencies within the data.

- **Multi-LSTM**: This advanced LSTM architecture tackles the challenge of analyzing data across multiple temporal windows simultaneously. This capability is crucial for capturing complex patterns at various time scales, enhancing the model's accuracy and robustness. Unlike conventional LSTMs, our Multi-LSTM allows for parameterization of both the number of LSTMs and the size of their temporal windows, enabling greater adaptability to diverse data.

- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: This final component acts as a decision layer, evaluating and combining the outputs from the previous stages. By integrating the general insights from earlier training stages with the specialized knowledge of later stages, the MLP provides a single, highly accurate prediction while avoiding overfitting.

The synergy between these components lies at the heart of the model's power. The precise anomaly detection capabilities of TranAD are complemented by the Multi-LSTM's ability to handle complex temporal dependencies. Finally, the MLP effectively combines these strengths, leading to a robust and versatile solution for anomaly detection in water consumption data.

### Interactive Anomaly Visualization

Our project is complemented by a comprehensive web application designed for user-friendly exploration of water consumption patterns and anomalies. This intuitive interface allows visualization of multiple time series simultaneously, aiding in informed decision-making. The application offers in-depth analysis of anomalous data, including visualizations of model predictions alongside actual consumption values, highlighting anomaly points. Furthermore, it empowers users to explore future consumption predictions and geographically visualize anomalies across different areas. By integrating socioeconomic indicators, the web application facilitates strategic decision-making for optimized water resource management.
