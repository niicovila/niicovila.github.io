I successfully presented my undergraduate thesis, "[Entropy-regularized Deep Reinforcement Learning from a Linear Programming Perspective](https://niicovila.github.io/projects/1_project/)" and received a score of 10. This marks the completion of my studies in Mathematical Engineering on Data Science, culminating in a final grade of 8.84/10. I'm excited to see what will come next.
