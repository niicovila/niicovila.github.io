Mathematical Engineering in Data Science at Pompeu Fabra. Exchange student at University of Chicago

Hey! I am final-year student at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/), graduating in Mathematical Engineering on Data Science. During the last year, where I studied as an exchange student at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), I developed a strong passion for Deep Learning and AI in general, which led me on to work as a research assistant at the Law School, focusing on the timely topic of fine-tuning LLMs for specific legal applications. As I explored a more rigorous study on how machines can learn, this passion has recently developed into a strong interest in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL). 

Currently, under the advisory of [Gergely Neu](https://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/), I am working in an undergraduate thesis which is focused on improving RL algorithms within both the MaxEnt-RL and Linear Programming frameworks, in large scale settings. In this work, I am particularly interested in working with algorithms that can rigorously acquire provable optimal solutions in any setting. This experience not only enhances my understanding of RL and its role in todaysâ€™ AI research, but also fuels my enthusiasm to contribute to research in the field.
