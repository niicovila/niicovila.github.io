Mathematical Engineering in Data Science at Pompeu Fabra. Exchange student at University of Chicago.

I recently finished my undergraduate studies in Mathematical Engineering on Data Science at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/), graduating at the top of my class. I am a machine learning engineer with a strong technical orientation. My research interests include reinforcement learning, optimal control, and developing AI models that can reason and act. 

During the last year, where I studied as an exchange student at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), I worked as a research assistant at the Law School, focusing on [fine-tuning LLMs for specific legal applications](https://niicovila.github.io/projects/6_project/). Later on, I worked at Amazon as a Data Engineer intern. As I explored a more rigorous perspective on how machines can learn and reason, I developed a strong interest in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL).

I recently finished my [undergraduate thesis](https://github.com/niicovila/Entropy-RL-Linear-Programming) under the advisory of [Gergely Neu](https://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/), titled "Entropy-regularized Deep Reinforcement Learning from a Linear Programming Perspective".
